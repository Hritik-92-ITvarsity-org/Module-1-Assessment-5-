                <p>Natasha Romanoff grew up as an operative training from a young age in the secretive Soviet "Red Room" program.

She worked for years as a formidable agent of the KGB before eventually defecting to the American agency SHIELD after becoming disillusioned with her Soviet superiors. Despite her lack of superpowers, Black Widow's "Red in her ledger" experience and deadly skillset made her an invaluable asset that SHIELD chose to recruit her to the Avengers team to provide logistical and investigative support.</p>
