                <p>Hulk (Bruce Banner)</p>
                <p>As a young genius scientist, Bruce Banner went to work at a military research base working on radiation experiments. Unfortunately, a gamma radiation accident turned Banner into the raging green monster known as the Hulk. When angered or excited, Banner transforms into the Hulk, with immense strength and durability that increases with his rage. The Hulk has been depicted as a destructive force that Bruce struggles to control. For years, Banner preferred to be a loner, avoiding the company of others for fear of triggering an uncontrollable Hulk transformation. However, he was eventually persuaded to join and lend his powers to the Avengers. Despite the Hulk's incredible abilities, Banner fears the damage the Hulk could unleash.</p>
