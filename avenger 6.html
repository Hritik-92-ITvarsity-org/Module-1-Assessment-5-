                <p>Thor</p>
                <p>Thor is the Norse god of thunder and the prince of the realm of Asgard. As an Asgardian, he possesses incredible strength, durability and the ability to summon lightning and control storms. He is also a masterful warrior, trained to wield his powerful hammer Mjolnir which allows him to fly and strike with intense force. However, at one point his arrogance and lust for battle caused him to be stripped of his powers by his father Odin. He was banished to Earth as a lesson in humility. After regaining his powers by proving himself worthy, Thor chose to remain on Earth to protect it as one of the founding Avengers members. His otherworldly nature and raw power makes him one of the most formidable heroes.</p>
